Arcsys (more like GGST) style input display for obs streams. 

Custom key mapping is throwing errors because of the global input plugin (and I spent way too long on this so I won't fix it.) 

So, I you want to change inputs, just download godot (it's like 100mb), change the input mapping and build the thing yourself again.
